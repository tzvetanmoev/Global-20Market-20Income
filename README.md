<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Here we use PPP-adjusted data on real incomes from the <a href="http://gcip.info/">Global Consumption and Income Project</a> to build an interactive visualisation demonstrating the changing shape of global income since 1980.</p>

<p>You can also download the data here in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzvetanmoev/WIDmarket_income_inequality/master/GCIPrawdata.xlsx" download="download"> xlsx </a> or <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tzvetanmoev/WIDmarket_income_inequality/master/GCIPrawdata.csv" download="download"> csv </a> formats.</p>

<p>Taller blocks correspond to higher incomes. Countries with larger populations are assigned more blocks. Colours correspond to how rich the country is in 1980, with poorer countries shaded red and richer countries shaded green. Countries are ordered according to mean income level in each year, while holding colours fixed from the 1980 levels. Therefore with these figures we can see inequality within and across countries over time as well as changes in average income.</p>

<p>This work was created for <a href="http://www.core-econ.org/">The CORE Project</a>. CORE is an open-access, interactive ebook-based course for anyone interested in learning about the economy and economics.</p>

<p>Visualisations created using <a href="https://www.amcharts.com/">amCharts</a></p>

<p>Bob Sutcliffe designed the representation of global inequality in this figure. A first version was published in: Sutcliffe, Robert B. 2001. <em>100 Ways of Seeing an Unequal World.</em> London: Zed Books.</p>

<h2 id="countries-included-in-gcip">Countries included in GCIP</h2>

<p> NOT AVAILABLE YET </p>

<p>Countries from the above list with population size under 750,000 are omitted from the graphs. The following countries included in GCIP are omitted from the graphs due to concerns over data consistency: Singapore (before 2000), Uganda, Bosnia and Herzegovina (from 1996), Georgia (from 1996), New Zealand. These countries constituted less than 0.1% of world population in 2014.</p>
