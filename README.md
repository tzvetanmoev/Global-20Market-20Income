Here I use data from the Global Consumption Income Project (http://gcip.info/) to build an interactive visualisation demonstrating the changing shape of global income since 1980. Taller blocks correspond to higher incomes. Countries with larger populations are assigned more blocks. Colours correspond to how rich the country is in 1980, with poorer countries shaded red and richer countries shaded green.

The full set of interactive graphs can by found in the docs folder. You may need to allow your browser to load scripts from unauthorized sources to enable the graphs to load properly. These are detailed figures so may take a little time to load.

This work was created for Core Economics. CORE is an open-access, interactive ebook-based course for anyone interested in learning about the economy and economics.
